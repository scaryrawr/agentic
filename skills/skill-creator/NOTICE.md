## Modification notice

This copy has been modified for GitHub Copilot CLI compatibility. Notable changes include:

- Rewrote `SKILL.md` to describe Copilot-focused skill workflows.
- Added `scripts/harnesses.py` for harness detection, command construction, Copilot project-skill staging, and trigger detection.
- Reworked `scripts/run_eval.py` to run trigger evals against Copilot by default, with legacy non-Copilot harnesses available only when explicitly selected.
- Reworked `scripts/improve_description.py` and `scripts/run_loop.py` to use Copilot by default instead of requiring `claude -p`.
- Added `scripts/run_harness_eval.py` to run Copilot task-output evals and produce the workspace layout expected by the viewer/benchmark tools.
- Modified `scripts/utils.py` and `scripts/quick_validate.py` to remove the PyYAML dependency for basic skill validation.
